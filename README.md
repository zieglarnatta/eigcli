Eig CLI robot command testing
Easiest way to start with this is to make sure you have installed: 
Robot framework: https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework
Robot SSH Library: https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary
and highly suggested pycharm from JetBRains https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/  as the IDE. 

Also optional, download at least the firefrox driver for each OS: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases 
and chrome driver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ for future / accompanying GUI team up verification 
asides from just pure SSH CLI command line confirmations
